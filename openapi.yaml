    ## Authentication
    
    Most endpoints require authentication via JWT token. Include the token in the `Authorization` header:
    
    ```
    Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...
    ```
    
    Tokens are obtained via the `/api/auth/login` endpoint and expire after 24 hours.
    
    ## Rate Limiting
    
    All endpoints are rate-limited. Check the response headers for rate limit information:
    
    - `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Maximum requests per window
    - `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Remaining requests in current window
    - `X-RateLimit-Reset`: Unix timestamp when window resets
    
    ## Error Handling
    
    All errors follow a standard format:
    
    ```json
    {
      "success": false,
      "error": "Error message",
      "code": "ERROR_CODE",
      "requestId": "uuid-v4",
      "details": {}
    }
    ```
    
    See the error codes section for a complete list of possible error codes.
