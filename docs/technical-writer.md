# Technical Writer Agent - Long-term Memory

## Overview

This document tracks the technical writer agent's evolution and best practices for documentation improvements.

## Active Work

- Issue #1175: Split oversized blueprint.md into focused documentation
- Currently extracting: Cache Configuration and Scheduled Tasks sections

## Past Work

- (To be added as work progresses)

## Best Practices

1. Keep documentation focused and modular
2. Maintain backward compatibility for links
3. Create index/navigation for related docs
4. Update references when splitting content

## Current Splitting Strategy

Starting with extracting clearly defined sections from blueprint.md:

1. Cache Configuration (lines 39-104)
2. Scheduled Tasks (lines 106-270)
3. Entity definitions and indexes (to be determined)

## Next Steps

- Extract Cache Configuration → docs/CACHE_CONFIG.md
- Extract Scheduled Tasks → docs/SCHEDULED_TASKS.md
- Update blueprint.md to reference new docs
